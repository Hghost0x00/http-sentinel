# HTTP Sentinel (HTTP Proxy Project)

> 🚧 **Just Getting Started** - This is a learning project being built from scratch!

Building an open-source HTTP proxy in Java - think BurpSuite but free and transparent.

## What I'm Building (Version 1)

A simple HTTP proxy that can intercept and inspect web traffic. Perfect for debugging web applications and learning how HTTP works under the hood.

## Why This Project?

- Building something useful for the developer community
- Documenting the entire journey publicly
- Creating an open-source alternative to expensive tools

## Current Status

📍 **Planning Phase** - Just started!
- [x] Project setup
- [x] Initial research
- [ ] Basic proxy server (coming next)

## Tech Stack

- **Java** (my main language)
- Pure Java networking (no frameworks yet)

## Timeline

**Goal:** ~100 hours for a working first version

I'll be documenting everything here and sharing progress on Twitter. This is as much about learning as it is about building something useful.
